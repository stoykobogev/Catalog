# Catalog
A project to showcase some technologies. Web design is poorly made as I'm not profitient in it.


## About the application
It's a simple Single-page application with REST API. You can create products and place them in categories. Products have name, price and optional image. There are two users (user management is not the goal). The 'admin' can do all CRUD operations while the 'user' can only view the content.


### Back-End tech stack
Java 8, Spring Boot (Spring Web, Spring Data, Spring Security), Hibernate, Maven, PostgreSQL, H2 Database, JUnit, Mockito etc.


### Front-End tech stack
Angular, Bootstrap
